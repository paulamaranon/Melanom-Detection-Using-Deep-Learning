# Melanom-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Convolutional neural networks were used for dealing with these clinical complex images.
Classical networks (pre-trained and built from scratch) and self-made architectures were trained and fine-tuned to achieve the highest recall rate.

I built three deep learning models: a simple neural network built from scratch, the classical AlexNet network, and a transfer learning model based on InceptionV3. This project focused on fine-tuning these models in order to obtain the correct classification of the highest possible number of melanoma images. The experiments utilised a dataset of 33,000 images of skin lesions and achieved better results than those explained in the relevant literature.
